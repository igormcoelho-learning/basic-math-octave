# basic-math-octave

This math exercise is a demonstration of using Octave for autograding using GitHub Classroom. This is the invitation link for the activity: https://classroom.github.com/a/M8rsjRoB (you may need to accept some invitation email automatically sent).

If you are an instructor/teacher/professor, feel free to learn more on how to create these tests in this post: 

## Instructions

*Please put your name here:* **YOUR NAME**

### Exercises

Edit the file `student.m` and fill in the solution for exercises 1 and 2 (from Calculus).

- Exercise 1: compute the derivative of function h(x)=xÂ²+x; 
- Exercise 2: compute the integral of function g(x)=x.

As can be noted, exercise 1 is already solved, so you may use it as an example in order to solve exercise 2.

### Autograding

Every change or commit will trigger the autograding actions, so you need to check the outcome:

- red cross: something is wrong (click on the red cross to find more information)
- green mark: all tests have passed
